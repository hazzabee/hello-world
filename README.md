# Welcome
This is my first repo! 

## Who am I?

I'm a technical writer. I have worked for **Barclays** and **Commonwealth Bank**. Now I work for **Ocado Technology**.

> Before starting to sync files, you must link an account in the **Synchronize** sub-menu.

## Save a file

You can save any file of the workspace to **Google Drive**, **Dropbox** or **GitHub** by opening the **Synchronize** sub-menu and clicking **Save on**. Even if a file in the workspace is already synced, you can save it to another location. StackEdit can sync one file with multiple locations and accounts.
