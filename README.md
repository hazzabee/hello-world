# Welcome
This is my first repo! 

## Who am I?

I'm a technical writer. I have worked for **Barclays** and **Commonwealth Bank**. Now I work for **Ocado Technology**.

> I also love creative writing. But I'll let you read about that elsewhere.

## Adding HTML

<html><b>test</b></html>

## Adding pics

To add a pic, add the pic to the repo and use the code below to link to it:

![pic](https://github.com/hazzabee/hello-world/blob/master/Amber-Run.jpeg?raw=true "This is the pic")

## Adding code blocks

To do a code block, you need to add three of these ''' before and after the code:

```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```
