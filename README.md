# Welcome
This is my first repo! 

## Who am I?

I'm a technical writer. I have worked for **Barclays** and **Commonwealth Bank**. Now I work for **Ocado Technology**.

> I also love creative writing. But I'll let you read about that elsewhere.

## Save a file

You can save any file of the workspace to **Google Drive**, **Dropbox** or **GitHub** by opening the **Synchronize** sub-menu and clicking **Save on**. Even if a file in the workspace is already synced, you can save it to another location. StackEdit can sync one file with multiple locations and accounts.

To add a pic, add the pic to the repo and use the code below to link to it:

![pic](https://github.com/hazzabee/hello-world/blob/master/Amber-Run.jpeg?raw=true "This is the pic")


To do a code block, you need to add three of these ''' before and after the code:

```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```
